# Sales Automation & Data Visualization with Google Apps Script

## BRIEF:

This project aimed to streamline the sales process and improve data management for a company. Previously, managing sales leads in Google Sheets proved cumbersome due to manual data entry, filtering, and distribution. This inefficiency slowed down sales associates and limited access to valuable insights.

## CHALLENGE:

Sales associates struggled to efficiently manage and utilize lead data stored in Google Sheets. Manual data entry, filtering, and distribution were time-consuming and prone to errors. This resulted in:
- Inaccurate data due to manual entry mistakes.
- Wasted time spent on repetitive tasks.
- Difficulty in understanding overall sales performance.
- Uneven distribution of leads across sales associates.

## WHAT WE DID:

Developed a Google Apps Script solution that automates lead distribution, filtering, and data visualization. This script:
- **Automated Lead Distribution:** Transfers leads to designated sales associates with a single click, ensuring efficient allocation and quicker follow-up.
- **Data Cleaning & Filtering:** Eliminates duplicates and filters out fake entries, improving data accuracy and saving time spent on manual cleaning.
- **Visual Dashboard Creation:** Built a comprehensive dashboard for real-time sales performance insights. This dashboard provides at-a-glance information on key metrics, allowing sales associates to make data-driven decisions and prioritize their efforts.

## RESULT:

This automation significantly reduced manual work, improved data accuracy, and provided valuable sales insights through a centralized dashboard. It empowers sales associates to focus on closing deals with better-managed leads and data. Increased efficiency and access to real-time performance data ultimately led to improved sales results for the company.
